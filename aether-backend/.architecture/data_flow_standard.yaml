# DATA FLOW STANDARD
# Abstract structure for documenting data flow in backend files
# All files must follow this 3-line format

version: "1.0.0"
standard_name: "Backend Data Flow Documentation Standard"

format:
  incoming:
    description: "Data sources entering this file"
    required_fields:
      - source_files: "List of exact file paths providing data"
      - data_types: "Explicit types (Dict, str, AsyncGenerator, etc.)"
      - data_format: "Structure/schema of incoming data"
    
  processing:
    description: "Operations performed on data within this file"
    required_fields:
      - operations: "Exact function/class/method names"
      - job_count: "Number of distinct operations"
      - job_types: "Categories (validation, transformation, routing, etc.)"
    
  outgoing:
    description: "Data destinations from this file"
    required_fields:
      - destination_files: "List of exact file paths receiving data"
      - data_types: "Explicit types being sent"
      - data_format: "Structure/schema of outgoing data"

  # file: example.py
  Incoming: source_a.py, source_b.py -- {type: Dict[str, Any], format: JSON}
  Processing: validate_input(), transform_data(), route_message() -- {jobs: 3, types: [validation, transformation, routing]}
  Outgoing: destination_x.py, destination_y.py -- {type: AsyncGenerator, format: streaming_chunks}

security_requirements:
  - "All data types must be explicit and validated"
  - "Input sources must be authenticated"
  - "Output destinations must be authorized"
  - "No implicit type conversions"
  - "All transformations must be logged"

modularity_requirements:
  - "Single Responsibility: Each file performs one cohesive function"
  - "Loose Coupling: Minimal dependencies between files"
  - "High Cohesion: Related operations grouped together"
  - "Clear Interfaces: Explicit function signatures"
  - "No Circular Dependencies: Enforce dependency hierarchy"
